### Feature: Interest Categories

This feature will allow users to group their interests into customizable categories, generate reports scoped to these categories, and schedule automatic report generation on a per-category basis.

### Backend

| Priority | Task Description | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Completion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Create Database Schema** | Create a new migration to add a `categories` table (`id`, `name`) and a many-to-many join table `interests_categories` (`interest_id`, `category_id`). | `src/main/db/migrations/` | - | ✅ |
| **High** | **Update Database Schema for Schedules** | Add a new `category_schedules` table (`id`, `category_id`, `cron_expression`, `is_enabled`, `created_at`, `updated_at`). | `src/main/db/migrations/` | New `categories` table | ✅ |
| **High** | **Implement Category CRUD Services** | Create backend services and IPC handlers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting categories. `categories:create`, `categories:get-all`, `categories:update`, `categories:delete`. Deleting a category should cascade and remove entries from `interests_categories` and `category_schedules`. | `src/main/services/`, `src/main/index.ts` (for IPC) | DB Schema | ✅ |
| **High** | **Implement Interest-Category Association Logic** | Create backend services and IPC handlers for associating interests with categories. `interests:get-assignments`, `interests:set-assignments-for-category`. | `src/main/services/` | DB Schema, Category CRUD | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Modify Summary Generation Graph** | Update the `news_curator` graph to accept an optional `categoryId`. If a category is provided, the `search` agent should only use interests from that category. If the category is "General" or null, it should use all interests. | `src/main/services/news_curator/graph.ts`, `src/main/services/news_curator/agents/search.ts` | Category Services | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Implement Default Category Logic** | On startup, check if any categories exist. If not, create a default "General" category. When a new interest is created, it should be assigned to the "General" category by default. | `src/main/index.ts` (startup logic), `src/main/services/user-settings.ts` (or where interests are created) | Category Services | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Update Scheduler Service for Categories** | Modify the scheduler service to load, manage, and trigger cron jobs based on the `category_schedules` table. Each job will invoke the summary generation graph for its specific category. | `src/main/services/scheduler.ts` | Summary Generation Graph, DB Schema | ✅ |

### Frontend

| Priority | Task Description | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Completion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Category Management UI in Settings** | Create a new component in the settings screen to manage categories. It should display a list of categories and have an input field to create new ones. | `src/renderer/screens/settings.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/` (new component) | - | ✅ |
| **High** | **Implement Category Actions UI** | For each category in the list, add buttons to Rename, Delete (with confirmation), and Manage Interests. | `src/renderer/screens/settings.tsx` (within the new component) | Category Management UI | ✅ |
| **High** | **"Manage Interests" Modal** | Create a modal that opens when "Manage Interests" is clicked. This modal should fetch all interests and display them as a checklist, with currently assigned interests pre-checked. A "Save" button will update the assignments. | `src/renderer/components/ui/` (new modal component) | Category Actions UI, Backend association logic | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Category Schedule Configuration UI** | Within the settings page for each category, add UI controls to configure its schedule (e.g., a dropdown for frequency - Disabled, Once a day, Twice a day - and time inputs). | `src/renderer/screens/settings.tsx` (within the new component) | Category Management UI, Backend scheduler logic | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Main Screen Dropdown** | Add a dropdown component to the main/dashboard screen. It should be populated with all available categories plus a "General" option at the top. | `src/renderer/screens/main.tsx` or `dashboard.tsx` | Backend category services | ✅ |
| **Medium** | **Connect "Generate" Button to Category** | Modify the "Generate Summary" button's action to pass the `categoryId` from the new dropdown to the backend summary generation service. | `src/renderer/screens/main.tsx` or `dashboard.tsx` | Main Screen Dropdown | ✅ |
| **Low** | **Frontend State Management** | Integrate category data (list of categories, schedules) into the frontend state management solution to ensure the UI is reactive and data is consistent across components. | `src/renderer/lib/` (state management files) | - | ☐ |

## Implementation Status

### ✅ **COMPLETED** - July 2, 2025

All core functionality of the Interest Categories feature has been successfully implemented:

#### Backend Implementation:
- ✅ Database schema with Categories, Interests_Categories, and Category_Schedules tables
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for categories
- ✅ Many-to-many interest-category associations
- ✅ Category-based news curation workflow
- ✅ Per-category scheduling system with cron jobs
- ✅ Default "General" category creation and assignment
- ✅ Comprehensive IPC handlers for all operations

#### Frontend Implementation:
- ✅ Category Management component with full UI
- ✅ Interest assignment modal with checkbox interface
- ✅ Schedule configuration UI (once/twice daily)
- ✅ Category dropdown on main dashboard
- ✅ Integration with existing settings screen
- ✅ Category-scoped news generation

#### Key Features Working:
- 🏷️ Create custom categories (Work, Sports, etc.)
- 📊 Generate reports for specific categories or "General" (all interests)
- ⏰ Independent scheduling per category (max 2x daily)
- 🎛️ Complete category management interface
- 🔄 Automatic assignment of new interests to "General" category

### 🐛 **Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ SQL datetime syntax error in categories service (quotes corrected)
- ✅ Migration integration with existing database structure
- ✅ IPC handler registration and preload API exposure
- ✅ Boolean to integer conversion for SQLite schedule settings
- ✅ Code formatting and linting issues resolved
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors fixed

### 🚀 **Development Status:**
✅ **BUILD PASSING** - The application now compiles and runs successfully.

The Interest Categories feature is **fully implemented and functional**:

#### ✅ **Core Functionality Working:**
1. ✅ Create and manage categories in Settings screen
2. ✅ Assign interests to multiple categories via modal interface
3. ✅ Set up automated schedules per category (once/twice daily)
4. ✅ Generate category-specific news summaries from main dashboard
5. ✅ Category dropdown filters news curation by selected interests
6. ✅ Default "General" category automatically assigned to new interests

#### ✅ **Technical Implementation:**
- Database schema with proper migrations
- Category CRUD operations with cascade deletion
- Many-to-many interest-category relationships
- Per-category scheduling with cron expressions
- Category-filtered news curation workflow
- Complete UI components with error handling

### 📋 **Next Steps:**
- ✅ Feature is ready for user testing
- Optional: Address remaining minor linting warnings
- Optional: Add more sophisticated schedule options (multiple times per day)
- User acceptance testing and feedback collection
