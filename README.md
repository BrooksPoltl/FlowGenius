## 🎯 Product Overview

FlowGenius is a desktop application that solves the problem of information overload by providing an intelligent, AI-powered news curation system. Unlike generic news feeds filled with clickbait, FlowGenius learns from your interactions to deliver increasingly relevant and personalized daily news briefings.

### **Core Value Propositions**

- **🧠 Intelligent Learning**: AI system that adapts to your interests through user feedback
- **🎯 Personalized Curation**: News ranked by your learned topic preferences  
- **📚 Complete Archive**: Full history of all news briefings with interaction tracking
- **🔍 Topic Discovery**: AI-powered topic extraction helps you discover new interests
- **📊 Transparency**: View your learned preferences and interaction analytics

### **Problem Statement**

Users are inundated with high-volume information from countless sources, making it difficult and time-consuming to stay informed on topics that matter most to them. Standard news feeds are generic, filled with clickbait, and fail to adapt to nuanced or evolving interests. FlowGenius provides a "smart" news client that actively filters noise and delivers concise, relevant briefings that improve with use.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack**

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Application Framework** | Electron 34.3.0 | Cross-platform desktop application |
| **Frontend** | React 19.0.0 + TypeScript | Modern UI with type safety |
| **AI Workflow Engine** | LangGraph 0.3.5 | Agent orchestration and state management |
| **Database** | SQLite (better-sqlite3) | Local data persistence |
| **News Data** | Brave Search API | High-quality news sources |
| **AI Processing** | OpenAI GPT-4 | Topic extraction and content analysis |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS 4.0.9 | Utility-first CSS framework |

### **AI Agent Architecture**

FlowGenius uses a sophisticated multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph:

```
🚀 START → 🔧 SettingsAgent → 🔍 SearchAgent → 📝 CurationAgent → 🏷️ TopicExtractorAgent → 📊 RankingAgent → 🎯 END
```

#### **Agent Responsibilities**

1. **🔧 SettingsAgent**: Loads user interests from database
2. **🔍 SearchAgent**: Fetches news from Brave Search API (10 articles per interest)
3. **📝 CurationAgent**: Deduplicates articles and saves new ones to database
4. **🏷️ TopicExtractorAgent**: Uses AI to extract 4 topics per article
5. **📊 RankingAgent**: Reorders articles based on learned topic preferences

### **Database Schema**

The application uses a normalized SQLite database with 9 core tables:

- **Articles**: News article storage with personalization scores
- **Interests**: User-defined topics to follow
- **Topics**: AI-extracted topic categories
- **Article_Topics**: Many-to-many relationship between articles and topics
- **TopicAffinities**: User's learned preferences for each topic
- **Interactions**: User interaction tracking (like/dislike/click)
- **WorkflowRuns**: Execution statistics and performance metrics
- **Briefings**: Historical news briefing archive
- **Briefing_Articles**: Links articles to specific briefings

### **Personalization Algorithm**

The learning system uses a **topic affinity scoring** approach:

```typescript
// Interaction Weights
Like: +0.1 to topic affinity
Dislike: -0.1 to topic affinity  
Click: +0.05 to topic affinity

// Article Scoring
personalización_score = Σ(topic_affinity * relevance_score) / topic_count
```
